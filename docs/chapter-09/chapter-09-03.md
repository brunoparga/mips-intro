Opening Window

## Answer

It should also be in the Start Menu on Windows computers.

You will see something like the above.
Some machine language has been loaded by default into the simulator.
The screen is divided into four
parts:

- **Register Display**:  This shows the
    contents of all
    32 general purpose registers, the
    floating point registers, and a few others.
- **Text Display**:  This shows the assembly
    language program source, the machine instructions
    they correspond to (shown in hex) ,
    and the addresses of their memory locations.
- **Data Display**:   This shows the
    sections of MIPS memory that hold data. 
    Click on the tab to see this.
- **SPIM Messages**:  This shows messages from
    the simulator (often error messages).

****Text** is the
name for machine language intended for execution.**
The word "program" is ambiguous, so "text" is used.
"Text" is a machine language program 
that may be executed by a process.

**A separate window, the **console window** shows
characters written by the simulated computer.**
It emulates a computer monitor.
This is where characters appear when your program 
is running and writes something to the simulated monitor.

## Question

What bit pattern is in the four bytes of simulated memory starting at 
the 32-bit address
0x00400000?

(Look at the first line of the text display just under the green arrow.)
