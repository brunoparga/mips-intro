End of Chapter

## Answer

(Review) In a typical computer system
(not a simulated one) where does the assembler place the
bit patterns it creates?

In an object module, stored as a disk file.

## Content

**With
the SPIM simulator the object module step is skipped.
The assembler puts the bit patterns directly into (simulated)
main memory.**

To end SPIM, click on File; exit in the menu bar.
