![Stack of Plates](/Chapter-25/stackPlates00.gif)

**A **stack** is a way of organizing data in memory.
Data items are visualized as behaving like a stack of
physical items.**
Often a stack is visualized as behaving like a stack of
dinner plates.
Data are added and removed from the stack data structure
in a way analogous to placing plates 
on the stack of plates and removing them.

Normally with a stack of dinner plates all operations take
place at the top of the stack.
If you need a plate, you take the one at the top of
the stack.
If you add a plate to the stack, you place it on top of the
stack.

## Question

Which plate is the last one that was added to the stack?
Which plate will be the first one removed?
