or 
**every bit pattern of N bits
there is a corresponding bit pattern of N bits which
produces an N-bit zero when the two patterns are used with
the binary addition algorithm.**
Each pattern can be thought of as representing the
negative of the number that is represented by the
other pattern.

## Question

Find the 8-bit pattern that gives eight zero-bits when
added to the bit pattern for 610.  
(Hint: start at the right column,
figure out what the ? has to be in each column, and work your way left.)

```
  0000 0110  =  610
  ???? ????  = -610
  —————————    ————
  0000 0000     010

```
