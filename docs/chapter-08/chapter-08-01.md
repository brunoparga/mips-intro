CHAPTER 8 — Binary Addition and Two's Complement

## Content

Digital computers use 
bit patterns to represent many types of data.
Various operations can be performed on data.
Computers perform operations on bit patterns.
With a good representation scheme,
bit patterns represent data 
and bit pattern manipulations represent
operations on data.

**The Binary Addition Algorithm inputs
two bit patterns representing  integers to create 
a third pattern which represents the sum of the integers.**

**Chapter Topics:**

- Single-bit Binary Addition Table
- Binary Addition Algorithm
- Addition in Hexadecimal Representation
- Sign-magnitude Representation
- Two's complement Representation
- Overflow  detection in unsigned binary
- Overflow detection in two's complement binary

Most processor chips implement the Binary Addition Algorithm
in silicon as part of their arithmetic logic unit. 
In a course in digital electronics you will study
the hardware details of its implementation.
This chapter discusses the fundamentals of the algorithm.

## Question

Compute the following. 
Give the answer in binary notation.

```
0 + 0 = ?
0 + 1 = ?
1 + 0 = ?
1 + 1 = ?

```
