A Longer Example

## Answer

```
  0110   =   6 (base 10)
  0111   =   7 (base 10) 
  1101   =  13 (base 10) 

```

Here is another example.
**The binary addition algorithm is the same
algorithm you use with ordinary base ten addition,
except now the base two addition table is used for each
column.**


| 0110 1110
0001 0111 | 0 
0110 1110
0001 0111
        1 | 10 
0110 1110
0001 0111
       01 | 110 
0110 1110
0001 0111
      101 | 1 110 
0110 1110
0001 0111
     0101 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11 110 
0110 1110
0001 0111
   0 0101 | 111 110 
0110 1110
0001 0111
  00 0101 | 1111 110 
0110 1110
0001 0111
 000 0101 | 01111 110 
 0110 1110
 0001 0111
 1000 0101 |   |
| The carry out of the left column in the final sum
can be discarded, in this case. 

But in general you
must be careful with it.  See the following pages. |

Check the answer by converting to
decimal representation and doing the addition in that base
(the same numbers are being added, but now
represented in a different way, so the sum is the 
same.)

```
  
   01111 110
    0110 1110    =  110 (base 10)
  + 0001 0111    =   23 (base 10)
    1000 0101    =  133 (base 10)

```

This would be a good time to play with the **Binary Addition Calculator** applet
in Appendix E.

## Question

Do the following:

```
  
    10  
  + 01   
    

```
