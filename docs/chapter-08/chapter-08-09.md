Additional Addition Practice

## Answer

```
              1 11      1  1
   0F4A → 0000 1111 0100 1010
   420B → 0100 0010 0000 1011
           0101 0001 0101 0101  → 0x5155

```

## Content

In
the answer (above),
the carry out of zero from the left column 
indicates
that **overflow did not happen.**

**Sometimes a hex addition problem is easy enough to
do without converting to binary:**

```
   014A
   4203 
   434D
  

```

It may be helpful to use your digits (fingers) in doing this:
to add A+3 extend three fingers and count `"A... B... C... D"`.

## Question

Compute the following sum using 8 bits.
Is there overflow?

```
   1101 0010
   0110 1101 
    


```
