End of the Chapter

## Answer

Subtract     0111 1000     from     1011 0000

0011 1000

(incorrect)

## Content

The 
integer to be subtracted is made negative ...

```
0111 1000 → 1000 0111 + 1 → 1000 1000

```

...then added to the other:

```
10000 000       
 1011 0000  = - 8010
 1000 1000  = -12010
 —————————     ————
 0011 1000     +5610        ???

```

Since the carry into the most significant column 
is *NOT* the same as the carry out,
the result is not correct.
