**Sometimes you need to add two numbers
represented in hexadecimal.
Usually it is easiest to convert

to do the addition.
Then convert back to hexadecimal.

Remember that converting representations from
hexadecimal to binary is easily done by using
the equivalence of hex digits and bit pattern
names.
