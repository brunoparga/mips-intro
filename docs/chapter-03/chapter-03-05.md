How Many Patterns from Three Bits?

## Answer

8 patterns can be formed from three bits, twice that of two bits.

## Content

**Repeat the trick.**
Make two copies of the table for two bits:

```
  0 0
  0 1
  1 0
  1 1
  
  0 0
  0 1
  1 0
  1 1

```

Now make each row unique by putting a "0" in front of the
first group and a "1" in front of the second group:

```
0 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 0
0 1 1
  
1 0 0
1 0 1
1 1 0
1 1 1

```

**Now you have all eight patterns that can be formed from three bits.**

## Question

How many patterns can be formed from **N** bits?
