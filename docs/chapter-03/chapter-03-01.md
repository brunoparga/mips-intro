CHAPTER 3 — Bits and Bit Patterns

## Content

![Toggle](/Chapter-03/toggleOff.gif)

**Computers
represent 
data and instructions
with patterns of bits.**
You must become
familiar with bit patterns!
This chapter will help you.
It discusses the fundamentals of bit patterns.

**Chapter Topics:**

- Patterns of bits.
- **The number of patterns that can be formed for N bits.**
- How to systematically list all the patterns for N bits.
- Multiplying powers of two.
- Bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.
- Names for four-bit patterns.
- **Hexadecimal names for bit patterns.**
- Octal names for bit patterns.

In most computer documentation,
8 contiguous bits are called a **byte**.
A bit holds a zero or a one,
possibly representing the on/off condition of
a switch.

## Question

How many patterns can be formed with a single bit? (Hint: click on the switch!)
