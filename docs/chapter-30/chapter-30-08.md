Negative Values

## Answer

`0.000456 = 4.56 × 10-4`

There must be only one digit to the left of the decimal place,
so an answer like `45.6 × 10-5` is not
in the correct format.

## Content

**A negative number has a negative sign in front of the
first digit:**

```
-1.38502 × 1003 = -(1.38502 × 1003) = -1385.02

```

The
notation for a small negative number has two negative signs:
one to negate the entire number and one (in the exponent) to shift the
decimal point left:

```
-1.38502 × 10-3 = -(1.38502 × 10-3) = -0.00138502

```
