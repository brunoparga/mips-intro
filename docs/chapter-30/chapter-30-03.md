Floating Point

## Answer

Float.

## Content

The
essential idea of floating point representation is
that **a fixed number of bits are used
(usually 32 or 64) and that the binary point 
"floats" to where it is needed in those bits.**
Of course, the computer only holds bit patterns.
Some of the bits of a floating point representation
must be used to say where the binary point lies.

Floating point expressions can represent numbers that
are very small and numbers that are very large.
When a floating point calculation is performed,
the binary point floats to the correct position in the result.
The programmer does not need to explicitly keep track of it.

## Question

Is floating point an old  or a  modern idea?
