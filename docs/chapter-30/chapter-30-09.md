Writing 
the multiplication symbol (×) and the superscript exponent is tedious,
and not suitable for programs.
A slightly altered notation is used in computer programs and in input and output text.
**The character e or E separates the mantissa from the exponent.**

```
 1.38502 × 10+03 =  1.38502e+03
 
 1.38502 × 10-03 =  1.38502e-03
 
-1.38502 × 10+03 = -1.38502e+03

-1.38502 × 10-03 = -1.38502e-03

```

Caution: For SPIM, only a small "e" is allowed in floating
point constants.
(Some software systems, such as Java, allow both upper and lower case e's).
