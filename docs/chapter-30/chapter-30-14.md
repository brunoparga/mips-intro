You
must be eager to try this yourself!! Here is an opportunity!

The decimal value 7.46875 written in base two positional
notation is `00111.01111 .`
What is the 23-bit mantissa of this number for IEEE?


| Represent this number: |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drop the leading zeros: |   |   |
| Move the binary point: 
keep track of the exponent |   |   |
| Drop the leading one: |   |   |
| Right-pad with zero:
to 23 bits |   |   |
| The Mantissa is: |   |   |
