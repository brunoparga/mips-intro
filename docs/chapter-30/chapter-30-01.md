# CHAPTER  30  — IEEE 754 Floating Point

**This
chapter is about the **IEEE 754 floating point standard.**
This is a standard for the floating point numbers that are used in nearly all
computers and programming languages since 1985.**
Java floating point (on its virtual processor)
and MIPS floating point (on real hardware) conform to this standard.

## Question

(Review: ) Is it absolutely essential that a processor
support floating point data?
