| 1.82371 | × | 101 | = | 1.82371 | × | 10 | = | 18.2371 | (move the point 1 place right) |

| 1.82371 | × | 10-1 | = | 1.82371 | × | .1 | = | .182371 | (move the point 1 place left) |
| 1.82371 | × | 102 | = | 1.82371 | × | 100 | = | 182.371 | (move the point 2 places right) |
| 1.82371 | × | 10-2 | = | 1.82371 | × | .01 | = | .0182371 | (move the point 2 places left) |


**The
exponent shows by what power of
 `10` to multiply the mantissa,
 or (the same thing) how far to float the decimal point.**

`10+n`
   means move the decimal point `n`
places **right**.

`10-n`
   means move the decimal point `n`
places **left**.
