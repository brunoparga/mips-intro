Scientific Notation

## Answer

Yes.  But before a floating point standard this was
sometimes not true.

To
address this problem the IEEE 
(Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
created a standard for floating point.
**This is the IEEE 754 standard,**
released in 1985 after many years of development.
All hardware and software since then follow this standard
(many processors also support older standards as well).

**The idea of floating point comes from **scientific notation**
for numbers.**
You have probably seen this before 
(and may already be shuddering).
Here is a number in scientific notation: `1.38502 × 1003`

The
mantissa always has a decimal point after the
first digit.
The above expression means:

```
1.38502 × 1000 = 1385.02

```

The decimal point "floats" to where it belongs.
In effect, **the mantissa gives the digits and the
exponent says where the decimal point should go.**

## Question

Write the following in scientific notation: `243.92`
