Early Floating Point

## Answer

Old.

## Content

The
first digital computer
(according to some) 
the Z3, built by

in 1941
used floating point representation.
This computer had a clock speed of five to ten Hertz and a memory of 64
words of 22 bits!
(The earlier Z1 machine also used floating point, but was not quite
programmable enough to be considered a computer.)

**Early computers were built to do engineering and scientific
calculation
so the invention of floating point
happened at the same time.**
In later years it was realized that computers are very useful
things, and not just for calculation.
Often floating point was not supported.

**Many early minicomputers and microprocessors did not directly
support floating point in hardware.**
For example, Intel processor chips before the 80486
did not directly support floating point.
A floating point operation in a program
(written in C, say) was compiled into a sequence of
bit-manipulation instructions that did the required operations.
Computers used for graphics or engineering calculation often
had an additional chip that performed floating point operations
in hardware.

**MIPS processors are very strong on floating point,**
and have supported the IEEE standard from their (and its) beginning.
MIPS chips are often used in high-end engineering 
and graphics workstations and
are famous for their fast floating point.

## Question

(Not very hard thought question: ) Do you imagine that in (say) 1975 that
the floating point methods used on IBM mainframes were the same as on
DEC minicomputers?
