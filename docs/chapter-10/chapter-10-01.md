# CHAPTER 10 — A MIPS  Programming Model

This chapter presents a ***programming model*** 
for the MIPS processor.
This is **a view
of a processor that is appropriate for
programming in assembly language 
but omits details**
that are not needed for that task.
It is the view of the machine a programmer uses
when programming.
