More Work for the Prolog

## Answer

Yes —  since this subroutine calls another subroutine.

## Content

`maxExp` will need to compute three values: 
`x*x`,
`x*y`, and
`5*y`,
and so will need to use S registers to hold them in.

## Question

Since this subroutine uses S registers, what else must
its prolog do?
