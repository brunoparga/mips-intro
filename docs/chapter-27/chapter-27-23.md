Another Long Example Program

## Answer

Yes.

That probably would not hurt.
But the next long example has a few points of
interest.

![console window](/Chapter-27/wynken.jpg)

Some
computers, 
such as the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Vax,
have specialized call and return machine instructions.
But experimentally these add  little to performance.
The general purpose instructions of a reduced instruction set
proved to be faster.

Here is an example program:
the program is to read in lines of text from the user.
Lower case characters from each line are converted to upper case.
The user quits the program by entering a single character 'Q' at
the start of a line.

## Question

How can character 'a' be converted to character 'A'?
