# CHAPTER  34 — Data Structures

Today, 
assembly language would not
be your first choice for building a data structure.
But in the past,
data structures were more
easily built with assembly language than with the
other programming languages of the time.
**In the first book written about data structures,
*The Art of Computer Programming* 
by Donald Knuth (1968), the examples were done
in assembly language.**

Times have changed.
Today most programming is done
with languages like Java or C.
**Data structures are easily implemented in these languages.**
But of course, 
the programs are compiled,
and ultimately they execute as machine code.

**To understand what is really going on,
it helps to look at data structures in assembly language.**
