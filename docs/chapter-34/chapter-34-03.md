Node

## Answer

No. The nodes (data items) are the same, but
their relationships are different.

Data
 structures can be built in main memory,
on hard disk, on punch cards, across the Internet, or in any
combination of any media that can store bits.
Let us simplify things and only talk about
data structures built in main memory.

**A **node** in a data structure is an
item of data.
The "structure" of the data structure consists of the
relationships between the nodes.**

Often nodes are called **elements**.
When thinking about the *structure* part of a data structure each
node is a unit.
Here is a picture of the list of the five  numbers:

**The arrows show the *successor* and *predecessor* relationships.**
The *first* node of the list has no arrow going into it;
the *last* node of the list has no arrow leaving it.
Here is the *structure* without the data:

## Question

Could types of data other than integers
be put in a linear order?
