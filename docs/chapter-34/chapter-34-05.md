The character '**j**'

## Content

**Often
  the nodes of a data structure themselves
have structure.**
Each item on our list is a sequence of characters.
This is OK.
The internal structure of the nodes does not
interfere with our view of the relationships between nodes.

It is common to have data structures that contain data structures as data,
that further contain data structures as data,
somewhat like a college campus that contains buildings, that contain class  rooms, that contain rows of desks.
