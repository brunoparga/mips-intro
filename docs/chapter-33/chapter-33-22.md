End of Chapter

## Answer

No,
I didn't mean that! I meant to say **useful** and interesting.

Here is my list of things that you might like to try:

- Put statements in the print subroutine that alter data in the struct.
- Write a subroutine that copies data from one struct to another.  The subroutine
    will have two arguments, the address of each struct.
- Write a subroutine that swaps the values of two structs.
- Put more fields in the struct and modify all the routines.
