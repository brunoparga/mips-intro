End of Chapter

## Answer

Break it.

## Content

Yes.
Break it into a `main` routine and two
subroutines, `create` and `print`.
Other things you can try: add several more data fields
to the nodes. Modify the creation and printing routines.

Add some code that asks the user for the number of
nodes to create in the linked list.
Perhaps add nodes in ascending order or descenting order.

Try altering the program so that each node contains
a string that the user types in.
To start, put the strings in a fixed-length field
of each node.
After that is working, 
further modify the program so each node is allocated
only enough memory for its string and its link field.
This will be really interesting.

For something less interesting, review the following concepts:

- [successor relationship](chapter-35-02)
Successor relationship.
- [nodes of a linked list](chapter-35-03)
nodes of a linked list.
- [memory allocation, for a node](chapter-35-04)
Memory allocation for a node.
- [header, of a linked list](chapter-35-05)
Linked list header
- [general case of adding a node](chapter-35-16)
General case of adding a node.
- [current node](chapter-35-10)
The current node.
