Main Memory

## Answer

No.  Potentially any byte of main memory
can hold part of a program or part of some data.

| **kilobyte:** | 210 = 1024 bytes |
| --- | --- |
| **megabyte:** | 220 = 1024 kilobytes |
| **gigabyte:** | 230 = 1024 megabytes |
| **terabyte:** | 240 = 1024 gigabytes |

**In practice, data and instructions are often placed in
different sections of memory,** but this is a matter
of software organization, not a hardware requirement.
Also, most computers have special sections of memory that
permanently hold programs (firmware stored in ROM),
and other sections that are permanently used for special purposes.

**Main memory (also called *main storage*, or just *memory*)
holds the bit patterns of machine instructions and the bit patterns of data.**
Memory chips and the electronics that controls them are concerned only
with saving bit patterns and returning them when requested.
No distinction is made between bit patterns that are intended as instructions
and bit patterns that are intended as data.
The amount of memory on a system is often described
using the terms in the table.

These days
the amount of main memory in a new desktop computer
ranges from 8 gigabytes to 32 gigabytes.
Hard disks and other secondary storage devices hold several terabytes.

Recall that in some contexts, SI units are used and the
prefixes *kilo, mega, giga,* and *tera* correspond
to powers of 10, not of two.
So *kilo* means *103* not *210*.

## Question

What is (on most computers) the smallest addressable unit of memory?
