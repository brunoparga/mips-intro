Objects

## Answer

An object is a section of main memory that
contains both data and methods and that
behaves like an individual entity.

![An Object](/Chapter-36/objectpicture.gif)

Objects
are often described as follows:

- **An object has **identity**** (it acts as a single whole).
- **An object has **state****(it has various properties, which might change).
- **An object has **behavior**** (it can do things and can have things done to it).

It is useful (but not quite accurate) to think of an object as
a contiguous chunk of memory that contains 
both
data and machine code,
as in the picture.

Of course,
general purpose memory
(symbolized by the yellow bricks in the picture)
can hold both data and machine code.
So an object can be built out of general
purpose memory.

In object oriented programming,
a subroutine of an object is often
called a
**method**
of the object.
So an object consists of data
and methods.

## Question

If a program constructed 1000 objects,
would it be efficient to make 1000 copies of the
machine code for each object?
