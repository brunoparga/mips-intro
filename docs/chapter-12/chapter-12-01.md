# CHAPTER 12 — Shift Instructions and Logic Instructions

## Content

### Chapter Topics:

- Logical shift instructions (`sll` and `srl`).
- No-op as a shift instruction.
- Bitwise logic instructions 
    (`or`, `and`, `xor`, `nor`).
- NOT as a NOR operation.
- MOVE as an OR operation.
- Example program: instruction assembly.

# CHAPTER 12 — Shift Instructions and Logic Instructions

**It
often happens 
that a bit pattern must be shifted several positions left or right.**
The instructions that do this are the **shift** instructions.

## Question

(Review:) If a bit pattern that represents an integer N
using unsigned binary
(say `0110 0001`) 
is shifted left by one bit 
(to `1100 0010`)
what integer does the new bit pattern represent?
