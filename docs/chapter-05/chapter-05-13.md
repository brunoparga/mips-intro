End of the Chapter

## Answer

Many types of data are represented
in a word processor file, using a variety of formats,
not just
characters.
A word processor file must also represent
fonts, 
character sizes,
formats,
colors, 
graphics, etc.
All these things are represented with
bit patterns.
Different word processors use different
bit patterns to indicate these things.
