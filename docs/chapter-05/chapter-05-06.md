Teletype Machines

## Answer

Yes. The better ones smelled of fresh machine oil
and chattered pleasantly as they worked.

## Content

**Teletype
machines were used from 1910 until about 1980 to
send and receive characters over telegraph lines.**
They were  made of electrical and mechanical parts.
They printed characters on a roll of paper.
Various mechanical actions of the machine were requested
from a distance by sending
*control characters* over the line.
A common control sequence was "carriage return" followed
by "linefeed".

(Sadly, the ` tag has been deprecated and is no longer used.)

Some models of Teletypes could be used off-line (not connected to anything).
The user could slowly and carefully type a message 
(or program) and have it
recorded as holes punched on a paper tape.
The device on the left of the machine
in the photo is the paper tape reader/puncher.
Once the paper tape was correct, the Teletype was put on-line and the
paper tape was quickly read in.
In those days, paper tape was *mass storage*.

The Web pages of the North American Communications Museum

have more information on Teletypes.

## Question

Can the bit patterns used to represent characters In ASCII
represent other
things in other contexts?
