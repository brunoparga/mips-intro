# CHAPTER 29 — Binary Fractions

Up
until now all of the
arithmetic we have done 
on the MIPS has been with integers,
both signed (two's complement)
and unsigned.
**This chapter starts the discussion
of how floating point arithmetic is
done on modern computers (including MIPS.)**

## Question

Is is possible to represent a
**negative** integer with a **positive**
number of bits?
