An infinite number.

**The limited precision of fixed point (and floating point) expressions
is a problem for programmers.**
Even with 64-bit double precision floating point 
(such as Java data type `double`) precision is limited.
Only `264` numbers can be represented.
This is a lot, but between
any two numbers that are represented there are an infinite number of
real numbers that are not represented!

(If your calculus is a little vague, don't worry. Just think about the
nearly infinite number of atoms between any two marks on even the most
precise ruler.)
