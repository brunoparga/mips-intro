Binary Addition Algorithm Works!

## Answer

| Power of 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | **.** | -1 | -2 | -3 | -4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 | **.** | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.125 | 0.0625 |
| Include? | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **.** | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

`(01111101) = 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.0625 = 7.8125`

## Content

**The
binary addition algorithm works for
eight-bit fixed point notation!**
In early computers and calculators this 
enabled the same electronic circuits to be used for 
integer arithmetic (both signed and unsigned) 
and for fixed point arithmetic.
This looks very promising.

However, fixed point is not as useful
as the **floating point** representation
which has replaced it.
Floating point will be discussed
in the next chapter.

## Question

How many values can be
represented using  8-bit fixed point representation?
