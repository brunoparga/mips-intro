Base Two Positional Notation

## Answer

0**.**31

## Content

**Positional
notation can be used with a base other than ten.
Here is a number written using base two:**



| 1 | 0 | 0 | **.** | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1×2<sup>2</sup> | 0×2<sup>1</sup> | 0×2<sup>0</sup> | **.** | 1×2<sup>-1</sup> | 0×2<sup>-2</sup> | 1×2<sup>-3</sup> |

When a particular power of the base is not needed, the digit '0' is used for
that position.
If the base is two, the point
`'.'` is called a ****binary point**.**

In general,
the mark used to separate the fraction from the whole number
is called a ****radix point**.**
In many European nations,
the radix point "," is used.
