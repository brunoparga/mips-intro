Positional Notation

## Answer

In the decimal value 12.6 what power of 10 is associated with:

- The digit 1? 10<sup>1</sup>
- The digit 2? 10<sup>0</sup>
- The digit 6? 10<sup>-1</sup>

This
is just **base 10 positional notation** which you know
about already.**The **decimal point** is put between the 10<sup>0</sup>
position and the  10<sup>-1</sup> position.**
Here is a longer example:



| 3 | 5 | 7 | **.** | 2 | 8 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3×10<sup>2</sup> | 5×10<sup>1</sup> | 7×10<sup>0</sup> | **.** | 2×10<sup>-1</sup> | 8×10<sup>-2</sup> | 4×10<sup>-3</sup> |

The notation `357.284` means 3 times 100, plus 5 times 10, plus 7 times 1,
plus 2 times 0.1, plus 8 times 0.01, plus 4 times 0.001.

## Question

Express `3/10 + 1/100` using positional notation.
