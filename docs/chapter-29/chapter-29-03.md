This
is just **base 10 positional notation** which you know
about already.**The **decimal point** is put between the 100
position and the  10-1 position.**
Here is a longer example:



| 3 | 5 | 7 | **.** | 2 | 8 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3×102 | 5×101 | 7×100 | **.** | 2×10-1 | 8×10-2 | 4×10-3 |

The notation `357.284` means 3 times 100, plus 5 times 10, plus 7 times 1,
plus 2 times 0.1, plus 8 times 0.01, plus 4 times 0.001.

## Question
