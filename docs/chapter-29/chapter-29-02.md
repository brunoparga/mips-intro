## Content

The
question is silly.
There is nothing mysterious about representing signed
numbers with bit patterns.
Here is another silly question:

Is it possible to represent a **fraction** with
a whole number of bits?

Of course.
Recall the fourth advantage of binary:
anything that can be represented with
patterns can be represented with bit patterns.
**It is just a matter of picking a bit pattern
for each fraction you wish to represent.**
There are several systematic ways to do this. 
This chapter discusses some of them.
