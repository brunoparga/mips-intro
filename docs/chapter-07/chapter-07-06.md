Unisgned Binary

## Answer

2<sup>8</sup> - 1   =  256 - 1   =  255.

There are 256 patterns possible with 8 bits.
But when these patterns represent integers,
One of the patterns (0000 0000) is used for zero.

## Content

**The
representation scheme we are looking at is
called **unsigned binary** because no
negative numbers are represented.**
Often when people say "binary number" this
is what they mean.
Here are some of its characteristics:

- With N bits, 
the integers 0, 1, 2,  ... , 2<sup>N</sup> - 1 can be
represented.
  - So, for instance, with 8 bits, the integers 0, 1,  ..., 2<sup>8</sup> - 1
  can be represented.
  This is 0 ... 255.
- With N bits, zero is represented by 0....0....0 (all 0's).
- (2<sup>N</sup> - 1) is represented by 1....1....1 (all 1's).

These facts are **NOT always true** for other representation schemes!
Know what scheme is being used before you decide what
a pattern represents.

## Question

Without doing any calculation,
which of the following is the decimal equivalent of
`1111 1111 1111`?

- 2048
- 4095
- 16384
- 18432

Look at fact 3 in the list and think a bit.

Hint: Actually, you should think about a bit.
