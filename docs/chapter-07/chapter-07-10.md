Adding
 a 0 to the end of an integer written in base sixteen multiplies
the integer by sixteen.
To multiply an integer by sixteenN, add N zeros on the right:

```
8B3 × 103 = 8B3000      (Here 10 means sixteen.)

```

remove the rightmost digit.**
The result is the quotient.
The removed digit is the remainder.

```
 8B3 div sixteen    =   8B (remainder 3).

```
