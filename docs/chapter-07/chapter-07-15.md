Converting between Representations

## Answer

```
100 111 011 011

```

## Content

With
 effort, you could directly translate between octal and hex notation.  
But it is much easier to use binary as an intermediate:

```
octal  →  binary  →  hexadecimal

```

You can convert a  representation of a number in  base B
directly to a  representation in  base Y.
**But it is   usually more convenient 
to use  decimal
or binary as an intermediate:**



```
Base B  →  Decimal  →  Base Y

Base B  →  Binary   →  Base Y

```

Which intermediate to pick depends on the problem.

## Question

Change the representation of this number from hexadecimal to octal (base 8):

> ```
> 0x1A4
> 
> ```
