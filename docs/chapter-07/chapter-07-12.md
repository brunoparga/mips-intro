Base 16 Representation and 4-bit Pattern Names

## Answer

What is the name of this 4-bit pattern: 1010 ?

A ― this is the name of the pattern the four bits make.

## Content

The
name of the binary pattern 1010 is "A".
The hex digit that
corresponds to the integer represented by 1010<sub>2</sub> is also "A".

It is OK to have a pattern that has the name "A" and also to use
"A" as a digit.

**If a 4-bit pattern represents an integer in base two,
that integer represented in base 16 is the 
same digit as the bit pattern name.**

The name of a 4-bit pattern 
(regarded as an abstract pattern)
is the same as the hexadecimal digit whose
representation in binary is that 4-bit pattern.
This is not accidental.

## Question

Here is an integer represented in base two:  1011.
What is the representation in base two of the number times sixteen?

Hint: remember that trick with appending zeros.
