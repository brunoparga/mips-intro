Shifting by one Place

## Answer

```
1B2 =  1 × sixteen2 + B × sixteen1 +  2 × sixteen0

1B2 =  110 × 162 + 1110 × 161 + 210 × 160

1B2 =  110 × 25610 + 1110 × 1610 + 210 ×110

1B2 =  25610 + 17610 + 210

1B2 =  43410

You
 already know how in base ten to multiply a number by 10: 
 add a zero to the end.
So 83 × 1**0**   =   83**0**.
This works because:

```
83       =     8 × 101 + 3 × 100

83  × 10 =  (  8 × 101 + 3 × 100 ) × 10

         =     8 × 102 + 3 × 101

         =     830

```

The same trick works in any base:

> **If a number is represented by
> (say) XYZ in base B, then XYZ0 represents
> that number times B.**

## Question
