It
 is convenient to remember the above fact.
If you know it, then it takes just a moment to
recognize `1001 = 910`,
`1011 = 1110`, and others.

To convert larger binary representations to decimal representation,
use a table.
You can create this table from scratch by multiplying the decimal values by two
starting on the right.


| Power of 2 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Decimal | 1024 | 512 | 256 | 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| Include? |   |   |   | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

**Think of the bits of the binary representation as turning on or off
the numbers to include in the sum.**
For example, with `1010 1010`
the various powers are turned on, as above.
