CHAPTER 7 — Binary and Hex Integer Representation

## Content

**Base 16 is often
used to represent integers.**
Integers represented in base 16 are said
to be represented with **hexadecimal** notation.
The hexadecimal representation of an integer is
equivalent to the pattern name of the bits in the
binary representation of the integer.

**It is easy to convert the representation of an integer between binary
and hexadecimal.**
Converting representations between decimal and an arbitrary base
is somewhat more difficult.
The chapter presents some algorithms for doing this.

**Chapter Topics:**

- Left and right shifts
- Unsigned binary representation
- Familiar binary integers
- Hexadecimal representation
- Equivalence of hexadecimal representation and bit pattern names
- Converting representations from hexadecimal to binary
- Converting representations from decimal to any base

## Question

A particular number is represented by 1010 (binary representation).
What is the number represented in base ten?
