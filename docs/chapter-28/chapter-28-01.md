# CHAPTER  28  —  Frame-based Linkage Convention, Variables, and Recursion

This
chapter builds further on
the stack-based linkage convention
to create a frame-based linkage convention.
**A **stack frame** is the section of
the run-time stack that holds the data
of a subroutine.**

The official linkage convention is
more elaborate than the convention
described here, but based on the
same ideas.

## Question

(Thought Question:) What is a *local variable* in a higher level language?
