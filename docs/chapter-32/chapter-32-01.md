# CHAPTER  32 — Floating Point Comparison Instructions

**MIPS 
has a condition bit that is set to
`0` or  `1` 
to indicate if a condition is false or true.**
Several FPA instructions affect this bit and
several CPU instructions test this bit.

## Question

Are the FPA (floating point accelerator) and coprocessor 1
the same?
