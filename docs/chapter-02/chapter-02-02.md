Binary

## Answer

Because it shows time using definite digits,
rather than positions of hands that have to be measured.
(It would be less correct to say "because it has a computer inside.")

## Content

**Binary means "two states."**
The two states are sometimes called "1" and "0",
or called "true" and "false",
or called "on" and "off",
(or other names.)
The essential characteristic is that a single
binary device can be in just one of two possible
states.

**A **bit** is a single "on/off" value.**

A good example is a toggle switch, 
such as a light switch.
You can turn it "on" or "off" but not
(in normal operation) anything else.
A light switch holds one bit of information.

A light dimmer is not a binary device: it has
many positions between "off" and "fully on".
If you want a light dimmer to be set to 25%,
you must carefully adjust it.
