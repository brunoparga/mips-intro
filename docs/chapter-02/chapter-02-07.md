An Analog Signal

## Answer

Perhaps.

The computation is done by moving beads to unambiguous positions.
A bead is either placed where it counts as part of a number,
or it is placed where it does not count.
This "all or nothing" operation means that an abacus is a discrete device.

**An
 **analog signal**
may continuously change in value.**
Its values can be anything within a range of values,
and its exact value at any time is important.
The graph below represents an analog signal.
**The exact value at each instant in time is part of the information it contains.**
For example, the  value at time "T2" must be measured exactly.

Now say that you are observing the voltage of a wire.
Let's agree that 
**any voltage below a
**threshold** will be counted as an "off" signal,
and that any value above the threshold will be 
counted as an "on" signal.**

## Question

At time "T2", is the signal "on" or "off"?
