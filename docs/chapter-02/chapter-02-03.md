The
ignition switch of an automobile is **discrete** — it
has definite states — but there are usually more than two states
(off, running, start, acc...)
A button on a calculator is a binary device.
It is either on or off.
Ordinarily it is "off."
When you push it, it is "on."
It springs back to "off" when you release it,
which is different from a toggle switch,
but it still is a binary device.

There are many advantages to binary.
Here are four (somewhat overlapping)
important reasons for using binary:

- **Simple and easy to build.**
- **Unambiguous signals (hence noise immunity).**
- **Flawless copies can be made.**
- **Anything that can be represented with
     some sort of pattern can be represented 
     with patterns of bits.**

These characteristics of binary were realized by
Claude Shannon, a mathematician at
Bell Telephone Laboratories.
His 1948 paper *A Mathematical Theory of Communication*
is the foundation of information theory and much of
computer science.
