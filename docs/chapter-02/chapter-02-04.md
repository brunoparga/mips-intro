**An
on/off switch is simple
and easy to build.**
An on/off switch moves two pieces of metal
together or moves them apart.
A light dimmer must gradually and smoothly
change the current that reaches the light.
It has more components that an on/off switch and
must be carefully assembled.
An accurate dimmer (where 25% means *exactly* 25%)
is even harder to build.

**The same is true for the tiny devices inside of a silicon chip.**
On/off switches are relatively easy to fabricate.
*Easy to build* means that the devices are cheap, small, and
reliable, and  millions of them can be put in a small area.
