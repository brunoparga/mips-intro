Clocks

## Answer

The system is built so that the signal is  tested only
at particular times, 
and that changes in the signal
occur between these times.

**Digital
 systems are built so that the
"on" "off" (binary) value is only tested at certain
times so the electronics
can change its state between these times.**
This is why computer systems have "clocks" — to
keep all these times synchronized.
Faster clocks mean wires can be tested more
times per second, and the whole system
runs faster.

Processor chips (and the computers that contain them)
are often described in terms of their clock speed.
Clock speed is measured in **Hertz**, where
one Hertz is one clock tick per second.

The symbol **MHz** means **mega Hertz**,
a million clock ticks per second.
The symbol **GHz** means **giga Hertz**,
a billion clock ticks per second.

A 700 MHz processor checks binary values
700 million times in each second.
In between these times values are allowed to change and settle down.
The faster a processor chip is,
the more times per second values can be tested,
and the more decisions per second can be made.

## Question

Which is faster, a 2 GHz processor or a 4 GHz processor?
