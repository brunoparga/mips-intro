Binary Signal

## Answer

ON

The analog signal 
(continuously changing voltage signal)
moves up and down, 
but at time "T2" it is clear that it is above the threshold.
Exact measurement is not needed.

## Content

Analog signals 
continuously change in value.
**By using a threshold, 
analog signals can represent binary data ("on/off" data).**
It is easy and fast (for electronics, as well as for humans)
to determine if a voltage is above  or below a threshold.
The figure shows a signal that
transmits  "off" then "on".
(The signal is examined at times T1 and T2.)

## Question

Is is clear that the signal is "off" at time T1
and "on" at time T2?
