*Binary Devices in Old North Church*

**Unambiguous Signals:
It is easy to tell if a light is on or off.**
Exactly how bright it is does not matter if all that
matters is "on" or "off."

Consider Paul Revere, waiting for 
news of the attack of the British troops.
He is expecting to see  a signal lantern
in the tower of
Old North Church telling him how the British 
are attacking:

> 1.32456 if by land, 1.71922 if by sea.

The signal shines out!
...and Paul Revere's famous ride is delayed
for several hours as he tries to figure out
just how bright that signal is.

**Lack of ambiguity is a tremendous advantage.**
The signal that Paul Revere was actually waiting 
for that night in 1775 was:

> One (lantern) if by land, and two (lanterns) if by sea.

...an easily interpreted signal.
All Paul Revere had to do was count.
Such signals are called **discrete**
because they have a fixed number of definite states.
Sometimes the word **digital** is used to mean the same thing.
