Different Processor Architectures

## Answer

No.  Each family of processor chip 
(MIPS, ARM, SPARC, Alpha, Motorola, Intel, ...)
has its own architecture.

*Levels of Computer Systems*

The
 **architecture** of a processor chip is a  description of
its basic components and of its basic operations.

Each processor family has its own architecture.
Assembly language is a programming view of 
the architecture of a particular processor.
**Each type of processor has its own assembly
language.**

When you study  an assembly language,
you  study  the architecture of a particular processor.
The  study of any assembly
language increases your 
professional understanding of computers. 
These notes are about the MIPS processor,
which is a nice processor to study.
The concepts in MIPS assembly
are universal.

These notes discuss assembly language
from a computer science perspective.
They explain
what is going on in a computer system at the
**assembly language level**.
This is a view that is above the
electronic view of computer architecture,
but is below the 
operating systems view of the computer system.

**Computer scientists understand computers at 
many levels.** 
They understand 
how the many levels  are built  one on top of another.
Each  of these levels corresponds to one
or more courses in a computer science degree program.

## Question

Does your understanding 
of computers
depend on which
assembly language
you study?
