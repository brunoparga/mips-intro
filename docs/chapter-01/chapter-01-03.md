Fundamentals

## Answer

No.  A well-designed modern assembly language is best, but any one is OK.

## Content

The
MIPS architecture is modern and well-designed.
The MIPS chip was designed from the ground up in 1985.
Its design includes 
the best ideas of computer architecture.
It may surprise you that something done in 1985 could be called "modern".
However, the fundamentals of any science change slowly, if at all.
**The MIPS is an excellent chip to study if you want to learn the
fundamentals of how computers work.**

**An assembly language program describes
exactly what the hardware
should do, step by step,
in terms of the basic operations of the
hardware.**
In a high level programming language like
C or Java a programmer is mostly unaware
of computer architecture.
The same source program can run
(after compiling) on 
any processor family.

These notes are about 
fundamental  assembly-level computer architecture.
To do this effectively it is necessary
to actually learn the assembly language and details
of a particular processor, and to write programs for it.
This is somewhat like those experiments you did in high
school chemistry.
Their goal was to teach you the fundamentals of chemistry,
not to teach you how to make test tubes 
full of colorful water.
But without the colorful experiments your understanding
of chemistry might remain abstract and vague,
and would soon be forgotten.
