How this can Help You

## Answer

No. The ideas of structured programming work for
any programming language.

## Content

In almost all problems (in life or in programming)
it helps to have a high-level view of what you are trying to achieve.
A high level view keeps you focused on the task 
and directs your efforts.
If you don't have a high-level view, you will probably
think only in terms of what to do next, and
you may never reach your goal.
You might flounder forever, making small moves 
that don't add up to progress.
This is like wandering aimlessly through 
a murky woods
without a map.
Or like trying to write a novel by picking
one word at a time.
Not likely to succeed.

**In programming, a high-level view is given by 
a top-level structured flowchart (very often
the Universal Flow Chart, modified to fit your task).**
Structuring forces the chart to be a genuine plan
and not merely a poorly-conceived collection 
of boxes and lines.
Any program can be designed to be structured.
If you show your program in a structured flowchart with a small
number of boxes, it will be a top-level plan.

Now you can more sensibly focus on smaller tasks,
and then yet smaller tasks, using the same method.**This method of **divide and conquer** is a very
powerful technique.**
