# CHAPTER 19 — Structured Programming

This  
chapter discusses two topics of great interest
in computer science:

- **What machine instructions are needed in a processor, and:**
- **How to build programs that work.**

The MIPS instructions you have looked at so far are more
than enough for a processor.
The *structured programming*
approach is used to build  reliable programs.

## Question

Much of the chapter is about the following question, which,
oddly, is usually ignored in introductory courses.

When is one processor more powerful than another?
