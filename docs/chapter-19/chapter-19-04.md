Minimum Instruction Set

## Answer

Of course. My  1.7 GHz processor quickly finds 33550336.

But, 
according to the definition of computing power,
my very fast processor is no more powerful than the SWAC.

Processors must control their peripheral devices,
and send and receive
information from them.
They do this by reading and
writing bit patterns on the system bus,
and by reading and writing special
memory addresses
that are assigned to peripherals.
So any processor that can read and write
memory can also control hard disks
and graphics boards.
No special kind of processor "power" is needed for that.
The multimedia instructions 
that have been added to recent processor chips
do not add extra computing power.
Of course, they do add convenience and speed.

What machine instructions must a
processor absolutely have?

Arithmetic
 (both integer and floating point)
can be done with bit manipulation instructions,
so arithmetic instructions are not fundamental
(but are almost always included in a processor).

**Above a certain minimum set of instructions
adding new instructions does not add to the computing power
of a processor.**

## Question

(Thought question:) Why do most processors have
many more instructions than the minimum set needed
for full computing power?
