**After initialization,
the program loops as long as there is data.**
When it reaches the end of the data,
it writes out the answer and exits.

There are still some details left to
specify, such as how the end of data
is determined.
This might be done with a special sentinel
value, or by prompting the user for a
"yes" or "no" response.
But the over-all design for the program
will be the same.
