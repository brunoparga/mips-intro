Looks like a Code Block

## Answer

Of course

![Four Structures](/Chapter-19/fourStructures.gif)

**In all of the structures so far:
there has been an entry point
at the top and an exit point at the bottom.**
There are no jumps into or out of the structure.
The entry point has entry conditions that are expected to be 
satisfied,
and exit conditions that are fulfilled if they are.
Each of the structures can be considered to be a code block.

It is OK for a structure to have jumps within it
(in assembly language, this is how some structures are implemented).
From the outside, each structure looks like
a code block.

## Question

Could a code block acting as a loop body be replaced by an
alternation structure?
