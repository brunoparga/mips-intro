Bit Patterns

## Answer

| !$@# | = | ! × (!@)<sup>$</sup> | + | $ × (!@)<sup>#</sup> | + | @ × (!@)<sup>!</sup> | + | # × (!@)<sup>@</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   | = | 1 × 4<sup>3</sup> | + | 3 × 4<sup>2</sup> | + | 0 × 4<sup>1</sup> | + | 2 × 4<sup>0</sup> |
|   | = | 1 × 64 | + | 3 × 16 | + | 0 × 4 | + | 2 × 1 |
|   | = | 64 | + | 48 | + | 0 | + | 2 |
|   | = | 114 |   |   |   |   |   |   |

Bit
patterns like `10110110110`
are sloppily called "binary numbers" even
when they represent other things 
(such as characters or machine instructions).

But, of course, bit patterns can be used to represent numbers.
Base two positional notation is used for this.

## Question

Fill in the blanks in the rules for base TWO positional notation:




- The base  is .
- There are   "digits": , , , ,  .
- Positions correspond to integer powers of , 
     starting with power  at the rightmost digit,
     and increasing right to left.
- The digit placed at a position shows how many times that
     power of  included in the number.
