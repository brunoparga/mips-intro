Representations

## Answer

No, but the question is vague.

## Content

To
be precise you would say that 
**`XII, ///// ///// //,` and `12`
 are different ways to **represent** the same number.**

There are many ways to represent that number.
The number is always the same number.
But a variety of ink marks 
(or pencil marks, or chalk smudges, 
or characters on a computer monitor)
can represent it.

In normal conversation and in writing
"number" often means 
*the representation of a number.*
For example, you might 
call

> ```
> 12
> 
> ```

a "number".
It would be tedious to call it
"an instance of the representation of a particular number using 
Arabic digits with the decimal system."
But that is what it is.

**Computer Science is concerned 
with using patterns
of bits to represent things.**
It is important to be clear about the
difference between the thing, 
and a representation of
the thing.
For example,
an integer
may be represented
using a bit pattern in computer memory.
(There are many different ways to do this.)
The integer is conceptual. 
The bit pattern
is only a representation of the concept.

## Question

Is XII even or odd?
