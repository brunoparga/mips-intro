For
**base 10** representation 
(often called *decimal representation*), 
the rules of positional notation are:

- The base  is **10**.
- There are **10**  digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 .
- Positions correspond to integer **powers of 10**, 
     starting with power 0 at the rightmost digit,
     and increasing right to left.
- The digit placed at a position shows how many times that
     power of **10** is included in the number.

A compact way of writing this  is:

Any integer can serve as the base for a positional representation system.
Five can serve as a base.
