Base Seven

## Answer

Change the representation of 1025 from base five to base ten.

1025   =   1 × 5102  +  0 × 5101 + 2 × 5100
   =   2510 + 210   =   2710

Here
is another example:  **3267.**  
This means:

```
 3 × seven2 + 2 × seven1 + 6 × seven0

```

To write the number in decimal, write the powers of seven in decimal
and perform the arithmetic:

```
3 ×  72 + 2 × 71 + 6 × 70 =

3 × 49  + 2 × 7 + 6 × 1 =

147 + 14 + 6    =    167

```
