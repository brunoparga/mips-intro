You
may wish to **change the representation of a number
from base 5 notation into base 10 notation.**
Do this by symbol replacement.
Change the base 5 symbols into the base 10 symbol
equivalents.
Then do the arithmetic in base 10.


| `4215` | = | `4 × five2  +  2 × five1 + 1 × five0` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the number in base 10 | = | `4 × 52  +  2 × 51 + 1 × 50` |
| the number in base 10 | = | `4 × 25  +  2 × 5 + 1 × 1` |
| the number  in base 10 | = | `100  +  10    + 1 = 111` |


The above process is often called "converting a number from base 5 to base 10".
But in fact, the *number* is not being converted, 
its *representation* is
being converted.
The characters "421 (base five)" and "111 (base ten)" represent the *same number*.
