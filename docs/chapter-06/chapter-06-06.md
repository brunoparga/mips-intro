Decimal Notation

## Answer

Yuck!

## Content

The
Roman numeral above is not a correct representation of an integer.
But it takes some inspection to decide this.
Decimal positional representation is clearly
better.

You already know how decimal notation works
(and probably would be happy to skip this topic).

```
324 means:  3 × 100  +  2 × 10  +  4 × 1 

which is:   3 × 102  +  2 × 101 +  4 × 100

```

Remember that:

```
B0   =  1,  no matter what number B is.

```

### Rules
for Positional Notation.

- The base  B is (usually) a positive integer.
- There are B "digits" representing zero up to (B minus one).
- Positions correspond to integer powers of B, starting with power zero,
     and increasing right to left.
- The digit placed at a position shows how many times that
     power of B is included in the number.
