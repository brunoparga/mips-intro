**What
you wrote is
a **representation** of the number.**
Here is one representation:

> ```
> XII
>

This may not be the representation you used
for your number.
Here is another representation for that same
number:

> ```
> ///// ///// //
> 
> ```

Perhaps you used this representation:

> ```
> 12
> 
> ```

or this:

> ```
> twelve
> 
> ```

or this:

> ```
> 
> 11002
> 
> ```

## Question

Are `XII, ///// ///// //,` and `12` different numbers?
