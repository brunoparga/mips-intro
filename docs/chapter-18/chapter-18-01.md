# CHAPTER 18 — Set Instructions

## Content

### Chapter Topics:

- *More Conditional Branch Instructions (one operand register):*
    - `bltz` instruction (branch on less than zero)
- `bgez` instruction (branch on greater or equal to zero)
- *Conditional Set Instructions:*
    - `slt` instruction (set on less than)
- `sltu` instruction (set on less than, unsigned)
- `slti` instruction (set on less than, immediate)
- `sltiu` instruction (set on less than, immediate unsigned)

# CHAPTER 18 — Set Instructions

This  
chapter describes 
**two more conditional
branch instructions
and two conditional **set** instructions.**
Set instructions set a register to
1 or 0 depending on whether a condition 
is true or false.

**These new instructions help you implement loops and branches.**
But this is still a difficult task.
Study this chapter to gain insight into what compilers do for you.

## Question

What two conditional branch instructions did the previous chapter discuss?
