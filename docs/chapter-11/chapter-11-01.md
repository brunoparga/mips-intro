# CHAPTER 11 —  Immediate Operands and Bitwise Logic

**Some 
machine instructions contain data as part of the instruction.
This data is an *immediate operand.***
The **ori**
instruction used in the previous chapter contains an immediate operand.

**With a *bitwise logic*  operation two bit patterns are
"lined up" and then an operation such as OR or AND is
performed between pairs of bits.**

## Question

Could a 32-bit MIPS instruction have room for  
16 bits of data?
