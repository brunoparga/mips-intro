# CHAPTER  24 ― Branch and Comparison Pseudoinstructions

The
MIPS hardware has several
instructions for branching and looping.

**These  basic instructions are used
to create many
pseudoinstructions** that give 
the programmer added
flexibility.

**Note:** for the example programs in this chapter,
set the SPIM simulator so that
pseudoinstructions are ON, delayed branches are OFF,
and delayed loading is OFF.

## Question

(Review:) What is a conditional branch?
